# Ghilbi Movies Collection

Welcome to the Ghilbi Movies Collection project, a dynamic, playful, and interactive web-based collection of Ghilbi Movies. The project is part of BeCode training, and it focuses on JavaScript consolidation concepts. It has been built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



## About
